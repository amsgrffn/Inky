    <p>Mr. McCarthy had promised Democrats <strong>fair treatment</strong> and a role in governing, but <a href="">then pushed intensely partisan</a> legislation that they found detestable. He cavalierly launched an <strong>impeachment inquiry</strong> into the Democratic president when he found himself on shaky ground with his <strong>right-wing troops</strong>. He cut a spending deal with the White House, then reneged on it â€” all the while saying he was doing what he thought was right for the nation. Yay!</p>
